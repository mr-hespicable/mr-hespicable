## hi, i’m @mr-hespicable
... or websafe on other platforms!

this is my github profile. my notes for school, as well as a bunch of my coding projects are located here.

in these projects, you'll find a variety of languages, such as java, python, ts & js (maybe?), but mainly _rust_.  
i've just finished coding a barebones operating system in rust for my duke of edinburgh award's **skills** section; if you're interested, check out the repo [here!](https://mr-hespicable/sketchos)   
i start a lot of projects which don't really get off the ground, but i love to work on them in my spare time, or when i have coder's block (haha)

and that's basically it :3 i’m not really looking to collaborate on anything atm, but if you would like chat or get in contact with me, dm me on discord (`websafe`) and i'll get back to you asap!
