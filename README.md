## Hi, I’m @mr-hespicable
... or websafe on other platforms!

This is my github profile. My notes for school, as well as a bunch of my coding projects are located here.

In these projects, you'll find a variety of languages, such as Java, Python, TS & JS (maybe?), but mainly _Rust_.  
I'm currently coding an operating system in Rust for my Duke of Edinburgh award's **skills** section.   
If you're interested, check out the repo [here!](https://mr-hespicable/sketchOS)

And that's basically it! <3 I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything atm, but if you would like chat or get in contact with me, dm me on discord (`websafe`) and I'll get back to you asap!
